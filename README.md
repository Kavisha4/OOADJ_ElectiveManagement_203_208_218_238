OOADJ Elective Management
In PES and many other institutions, students are required to take elective courses to fulfill their degree requirements. 
However, with a large number of students and limited seats in each course, it can be difficult to ensure that all students get their preferred electives. 
This can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among students, as well as poor academic performance if they are forced to take courses they are not 
interested in. To address this issue, we propose the development of an elective course segregation application using Java.
